This folder is for summary project of the previous sources. 

The program consists of the two phases:

1st phase (Planning): With the given grids, it plans the path with A* algorhism.
Then it smoothens the path.

2nd phase (Controling): The program controls the car following the planned path.
In this phase, the localization is performed with particle filter and the controlling is done with PD control.
The motion of the car is modeled with the bycicle model.
